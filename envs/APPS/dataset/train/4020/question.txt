You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?

Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.

These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:

* hello - english
* ciao - italian
* salut - french
* hallo - german
* hola - spanish
* ahoj - czech republic
* czesc - polish

By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!!


PS. you can assume the input is a string.
PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test)

PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests
