Build a function `sumNestedNumbers`/`sum_nested_numbers` that finds the sum of all numbers in a series of nested arrays raised to the power of their respective nesting levels.  Numbers in the outer most array should be raised to the power of 1.

For example,

should return `1 + 2*2 + 3 + 4*4 + 5*5*5 === 149`
