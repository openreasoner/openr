Create a function that takes a string and returns that
string with the first half lowercased and the last half uppercased.

eg: foobar == fooBAR

If it is an odd number then 'round' it up to find which letters to uppercase. See example below.

    sillycase("brian")  
    //         --^-- midpoint  
    //         bri    first half (lower-cased)  
    //            AN second half (upper-cased)
