Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array `[1,2,3,4,6,7,8]` then `1` then `2` then `3` then `4` are all consecutive but `6` is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

```if:c
If a non consecutive number is found then return `true` and set the passed in pointer to the number found.

If the whole array is consecutive then return `false`.
```
```if-not:c
If the whole array is consecutive then return `null`^(2).
```
The array will always have at least `2` elements^(1) and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

```if:c
^(1) Can you write a solution that will return `false` for both `[]` and `[ x ]` (an empty array and one with a single number) though? (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )
```
```if-not:c
^(1) Can you write a solution that will return `null`^(2) for both `[]` and `[ x ]` though?  (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )

^(2)  
Swift, Ruby and Crystal: `nil`  
Haskell: `Nothing`  
Python, Rust: `None`  
Julia: `nothing`  
Nim: `none(int)` (See [options](https://nim-lang.org/docs/options.html))
