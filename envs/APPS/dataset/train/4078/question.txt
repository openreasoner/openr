Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests (so, fair warning, be aware that you are not getting out of it just throwing a lame bas sorting method there) with an array/list/vector of integers and the expected number `n` of smallest elements to return.

Also:

* the number of elements to be returned cannot be higher than the array/list/vector length;
* elements can be duplicated;
* in case of duplicates, just return them according to the original order (see third example for more clarity).

Same examples and more in the test cases:

```python
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],3) == [1,2,3]
first_n_smallest([5,4,3,2,1],3) == [3,2,1]
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,1],3) == [1,2,1]
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,-4,0],3) == [1,-4,0]
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],0) == []
```
