The magic sum of 3s is calculated on an array by summing up odd numbers which include the digit `3`. Write a function `magic_sum` which accepts an array of integers and returns the sum.

*Example:* `[3, 12, 5, 8, 30, 13]` results in `16` (`3` + `13`)

If the sum cannot be calculated, `0` should be returned.
