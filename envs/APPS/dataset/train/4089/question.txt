The number 45 is the first integer in having this interesting property:
the sum of the number with its reversed is divisible by the difference between them(absolute Value).
```
45 + 54 = 99 
abs(45 - 54) = 9
99 is divisible by 9.
```
The first terms of this special sequence are :
```
n               a(n)
1               45
2               54
3               495
4               594
```
Make the function ```sum_dif_rev()```(`sumDivRef` in JavaScript and CoffeeScript), that receives ```n```, the ordinal number of the term and may give us, the value of the term of the sequence.
```python
sum_dif_rev(n) -----> a(n)
```
Let's see some cases:
```python
sum_dif_rev(1) -----> 45
sum_dif_rev(3) -----> 495
```
"Important: Do not include numbers which, when reversed, have a leading zero, e.g.: 1890 reversed is 0981, so 1890 should not be included."

Your code will be tested up to the first 65 terms, so you should think to optimize it as much as you can.

(Hint: I memoize, you memoize, he memoizes, ......they (of course) memoize)

Happy coding!!
