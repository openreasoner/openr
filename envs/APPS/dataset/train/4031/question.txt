# Esolang Interpreters #2 - Custom Smallfuck Interpreter

## About this Kata Series

"Esolang Interpreters" is a Kata Series that originally began as three separate, independent esolang interpreter Kata authored by [@donaldsebleung](http://codewars.com/users/donaldsebleung) which all shared a similar format and were all somewhat inter-related.  Under the influence of [a fellow Codewarrior](https://www.codewars.com/users/nickkwest), these three high-level inter-related Kata gradually evolved into what is known today as the "Esolang Interpreters" series.

This series is a high-level Kata Series designed to challenge the minds of bright and daring programmers by implementing interpreters for various [esoteric programming languages/Esolangs](http://esolangs.org), mainly [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) derivatives but not limited to them, given a certain specification for a certain Esolang.  Perhaps the only exception to this rule is the very first Kata in this Series which is intended as an introduction/taster to the world of esoteric programming languages and writing interpreters for them.

## The Language

Smallfuck is an [esoteric programming language/Esolang](http://esolangs.org) invented in 2002 which is a sized-down variant of the famous [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) Esolang.  Key differences include:

- Smallfuck operates only on bits as opposed to bytes
- It has a limited data storage which varies from implementation to implementation depending on the size of the tape
- It does not define input or output - the "input" is encoded in the initial state of the data storage (tape) and the "output" should be decoded in the final state of the data storage (tape)

Here are a list of commands in Smallfuck:

- `>` - Move pointer to the right (by 1 cell)
- `<` - Move pointer to the left (by 1 cell)
- `*` - Flip the bit at the current cell
- `[` - Jump past matching `]` if value at current cell is `0`
- `]` - Jump back to matching `[` (if value at current cell is nonzero)

As opposed to Brainfuck where a program terminates only when all of the commands in the program have been considered (left to right), Smallfuck terminates when any of the two conditions mentioned below become true:

- All commands have been considered from left to right
- The pointer goes out-of-bounds (i.e. if it moves to the left of the first cell or to the right of the last cell of the tape)

Smallfuck is considered to be Turing-complete **if and only if** it had a tape of infinite length; however, since the length of the tape is always defined as finite (as the interpreter cannot return a tape of infinite length), its computational class is of bounded-storage machines with bounded input.

More information on this Esolang can be found [here](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Smallfuck).

## The Task

Implement a custom Smallfuck interpreter `interpreter()` (`interpreter` in Haskell and F#, `Interpreter` in C#, `custom_small_fuck:interpreter/2` in Erlang) which accepts the following arguments:

1. `code` - **Required**.  The Smallfuck program to be executed, passed in as a string.  May contain non-command characters.  Your interpreter should simply ignore any non-command characters.
2. `tape` - **Required**.  The initial state of the data storage (tape), passed in **as a string**.  For example, if the string `"00101100"` is passed in then it should translate to something of this form within your interpreter: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.  You may assume that all input strings for `tape` will be non-empty and will only contain `"0"`s and `"1"`s.

Your interpreter should return the final state of the data storage (tape) **as a string** in the same format that it was passed in.  For example, if the tape in your interpreter ends up being `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` then return the string `"11111"`.

*NOTE: The pointer of the interpreter always starts from the first (leftmost) cell of the tape, same as in Brainfuck.*

Good luck :D
