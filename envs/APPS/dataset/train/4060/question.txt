# Background

My pet bridge-maker ants are marching across a terrain from left to right.

If they encounter a gap, the first one stops and then next one climbs over him, then the next, and the next, until a bridge is formed across the gap. 

What clever little things they are!

Now all the other ants can walk over the ant-bridge.

When the last ant is across, the ant-bridge dismantles itself similar to how it was constructed.

This process repeats as many times as necessary (there may be more than one gap to cross) until all the ants reach the right hand side.

# Kata Task

My little ants are marching across the terrain from left-to-right in the order ```A``` then ```B``` then ```C```...

What order do they exit on the right hand side?

# Notes

* ```-``` = solid ground
* ```.``` = a gap
* The number of ants may differ but there are always enough ants to bridge the gaps
* The terrain never starts or ends with a gap
* Ants cannot pass other ants except by going over ant-bridges
* If there is ever ambiguity which ant should move, then the ant at the **back** moves first

# Example

## Input
* ants = ````GFEDCBA````
* terrain = ```------------...-----------```

## Output
* result = ```EDCBAGF```

## Details


Ants moving left to right.
GFEDCBA
------------...-----------

The first one arrives at a gap.
GFEDCB     A
------------...-----------

They start to bridge over the gap...
GFED       ABC
------------...-----------

...until the ant-bridge is completed!
GF         ABCDE
------------...-----------

And then the remaining ants can walk across the bridge.
               F
G          ABCDE
------------...-----------

And when no more ants need to cross...
           ABCDE        GF
------------...-----------

... the bridge dismantles itself one ant at a time....                
             CDE      BAGF
------------...-----------

...until all ants get to the other side                
                   EDCBAGF
