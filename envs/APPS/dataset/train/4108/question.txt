# Task

Write a function named `sumEvenNumbers`, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence.

Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even. 

## Input
* sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats. 


For example, considering this input value : `[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8]`, then your function should return `30` (because `4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30`).
