Given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string, preserving the order.

For example, give the string "-1,2,3,4,5", the function string_to_int_list() should return [-1,2,3,4,5]

Please note that there can be one or more consecutive commas whithout numbers, like so: "-1,-2,,,,,,3,4,5,,6"
