1000000000000001 dogs suddenly appeared under the roof of Roger's house, all of which he decided to keep. The dogs had been numbered 1 through 1000000000000001, but he gave them new names, as follows:
 - the dogs numbered 1,2,\cdots,26 were respectively given the names a, b, ..., z;
 - the dogs numbered 27,28,29,\cdots,701,702  were respectively given the names aa, ab, ac, ..., zy, zz;
 - the dogs numbered 703,704,705,\cdots,18277,18278  were respectively given the names aaa, aab, aac, ..., zzy, zzz;
 - the dogs numbered 18279,18280,18281,\cdots,475253,475254  were respectively given the names aaaa, aaab, aaac, ..., zzzy, zzzz;
 - the dogs numbered 475255,475256,\cdots  were respectively given the names aaaaa, aaaab, ...;
 - and so on.
To sum it up, the dogs numbered 1, 2, \cdots were respectively given the following names:
a, b, ..., z, aa, ab, ..., az, ba, bb, ..., bz, ..., za, zb, ..., zz, aaa, aab, ..., aaz, aba, abb, ..., abz, ..., zzz, aaaa, ...
