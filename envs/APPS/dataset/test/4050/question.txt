This problem is given in two editions, which differ exclusively in the constraints on the number $n$.

You are given an array of integers $a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n].$ A block is a sequence of contiguous (consecutive) elements $a[l], a[l+1], \dots, a[r]$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$). Thus, a block is defined by a pair of indices $(l, r)$.

Find a set of blocks $(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \dots, (l_k, r_k)$ such that:

  They do not intersect (i.e. they are disjoint). Formally, for each pair of blocks $(l_i, r_i)$ and $(l_j, r_j$) where $i \neq j$ either $r_i < l_j$ or $r_j < l_i$.  For each block the sum of its elements is the same. Formally, $$a[l_1]+a[l_1+1]+\dots+a[r_1]=a[l_2]+a[l_2+1]+\dots+a[r_2]=$$ $$\dots =$$ $$a[l_k]+a[l_k+1]+\dots+a[r_k].$$  The number of the blocks in the set is maximum. Formally, there does not exist a set of blocks $(l_1', r_1'), (l_2', r_2'), \dots, (l_{k'}', r_{k'}')$ satisfying the above two requirements with $k' > k$. 

 $\left. \begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline 4 & {1} & {2} & {2} & {1} & {5} & {3} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$ The picture corresponds to the first example. Blue boxes illustrate blocks. 

Write a program to find such a set of blocks.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the length of the given array. The second line contains the sequence of elements $a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n]$ ($-10^5 \le a_i \le 10^5$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print the integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le n$). The following $k$ lines should contain blocks, one per line. In each line print a pair of indices $l_i, r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) — the bounds of the $i$-th block. You can print blocks in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
