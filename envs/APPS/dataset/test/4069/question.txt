Takahashi, who lives on the number line, is now at coordinate X. He will make exactly K moves of distance D in the positive or negative direction.
More specifically, in one move, he can go from coordinate x to x + D or x - D.
He wants to make K moves so that the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination will be the smallest possible.
Find the minimum possible absolute value of the coordinate of the destination.

-----Constraints-----
 - -10^{15} \leq X \leq 10^{15}
 - 1 \leq K \leq 10^{15}
 - 1 \leq D \leq 10^{15}
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X K D

-----Output-----
Print the minimum possible absolute value of the coordinate of the destination.

-----Sample Input-----
6 2 4

-----Sample Output-----
2

Takahashi is now at coordinate 6. It is optimal to make the following moves:
 - Move from coordinate 6 to (6 - 4 =) 2.
 - Move from coordinate 2 to (2 - 4 =) -2.
Here, the absolute value of the coordinate of the destination is 2, and we cannot make it smaller.
