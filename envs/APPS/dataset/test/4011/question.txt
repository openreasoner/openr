You are given a long decimal number $a$ consisting of $n$ digits from $1$ to $9$. You also have a function $f$ that maps every digit from $1$ to $9$ to some (possibly the same) digit from $1$ to $9$.

You can perform the following operation no more than once: choose a non-empty contiguous subsegment of digits in $a$, and replace each digit $x$ from this segment with $f(x)$. For example, if $a = 1337$, $f(1) = 1$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(7) = 3$, and you choose the segment consisting of three rightmost digits, you get $1553$ as the result.

What is the maximum possible number you can obtain applying this operation no more than once?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of digits in $a$.

The second line contains a string of $n$ characters, denoting the number $a$. Each character is a decimal digit from $1$ to $9$.

The third line contains exactly $9$ integers $f(1)$, $f(2)$, ..., $f(9)$ ($1 \le f(i) \le 9$).


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number you can get after applying the operation described in the statement no more than once.
