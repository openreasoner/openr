In this step, you need to write Python codes to solve the query. Use the simplest and most straightforward programming methods to solve the problem. For instance, if a query can be efficiently solved using a brute force method, prefer it over heuristic or more complex methods. Utilize any available and commonly-used libraries that can simplify the task or improve code maintainability. All the calculations must leverage codes. Print out the results with the print() function. Before executing the program, you have no idea of the final answer. Don’t show it in your comment or code. And don’t use the plot function.
In this step, start with “# Now write Python codes to answer this question and use print() to print out the result”
