1. **1x1 Squares:**
   - Each point in the grid can be the top-left corner of a \( 1 \times 1 \) square.
   - There are \( 3 \) rows and \( n \) columns.
   - Therefore, the total number of \( 1 \times 1 \) squares is:
     \[
     3 \times n = 3n
     \]

2. **2x2 Squares:**
   - A \( 2 \times 2 \) square requires 2 consecutive rows and 2 consecutive columns.
   - There are \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) possible rows and \( n - 1 \) possible columns.
   - Therefore, the total number of \( 2 \times 2 \) squares is:
     \[
     2 \times (n - 1) = 2(n - 1) = 2n - 2
     \]

3. **3x3 Squares:**
   - A \( 3 \times 3 \) square requires 3 consecutive rows and 3 consecutive columns.
   - There are \( 3 - 2j = 1 \) possible row and \( n - 2 \) possible columns.
   - Therefore, the total number of \( 3 \times 3 \) squares is:
     \[
     1 \times (n - 2) = n - 2
     \]

### Setting Up the Equation

We know the total number of squares is 70. Therefore, we sum the number of squares of each size and set it equal to 70:
\[
3n + (2n - 2) + (n - 2) = 70
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
3n + 2n - 2 + n - 2 = 70
\]
\[
6n - 4 = 70
\]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[
6n = 74
\]

Divide by 6:
\[
n = \frac{74}{6}
\]
\[
n = 12.3333
\]

Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\tan 100^\\circ + 4 \\sin 100^\\circ = -\\tan 80^\\circ + 4 \\sin 100^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the identity \\(\\sin 100^\\circ = \\sin (180^\\circ - 80^\\circ) = \\sin 80^\\circ\\). So the expression further simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-\\tan 80^\\circ + 4 \\sin 80^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe can express \\(\\tan 80^\\circ\\) as \\(\\frac{\\sin 80^\\circ}{\\cos 80^\\circ}\\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\sin 80^\\circ}{\\cos 80^\\circ} + 4 \\sin 80^\\circ\n\\]\n\nTo combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is \\(\\cos 80^\\circ\\), so we rewrite the expression as:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\sin 80^\\circ}{\\cos 80^\\circ} + \\frac{4 \\sin 80^\\circ \\cos 80^\\circ}{\\cos 80^\\circ} = \\frac{-\\sin 80^\\circ + 4 \\sin 80^\\circ \\cos 80^\\circ}{\\cos 80^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nWe can factor out \\(\\sin 80^\\circ\\) from the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin 80^\\circ (-1 + 4 \\cos 80^\\circ)}{\\cos 80^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 80^\\circ \\cdot \\frac{-1 + 4 \\cos 80^\\circ}{\\cos 80^\\circ} = \\sin 80^\\circ \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\cos 80^\\circ} + 4 \\right) = \\sin 80^\\circ \\left( -\\sec 80^\\circ + 4 \\right)\n\\]\n\nWe know from trigonometric identities that \\(\\sec 80^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\cos 80^\\circ} = \\csc 10^\\circ\\) (since \\(\\sec (90^\\circ - \\theta) = \\csc \\theta\\)). Therefore, \\(-\\sec 80^\\circ = -\\csc 10^\\circ\\). So the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 80^\\circ \\left( -\\csc 10^\\circ + 4 \\right) = \\sin 80^\\circ \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sin 10^\\circ} + 4 \\right)\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite \\(\\sin 80^\\circ\\) as \\(\\cos 10^\\circ\\) (since \\(\\sin (90^\\circ - \\theta) = \\cos \\theta\\)). So the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 10^\\circ \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sin 10^\\circ} + 4 \\right) = \\cos 10^\\circ \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sin 10^\\circ} \\right) + \\cos 10^\\circ \\cdot 4 = -\\frac{\\cos 10^\\circ}{\\sin 10^\\circ} + 4 \\cos 10^\\circ = -\\cot 10^\\circ + 4 \\cos 10^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe know from trigonometric identities that \\(\\cot 10^\\circ = \\frac{\\cos 10^\\circ}{\\sin 10^\\circ}\\). So we have:\n\n\\[\n-\\cot 10^\\circ + 4 \\cos 10^\\circ = -\\frac{\\cos 10^\\circ}{\\sin 10^\\circ} + 4 \\cos 10^\\circ = -\\frac{\\cos 10^\\circ}{\\sin 10^\\circ} + \\frac{4 \\cos 10^\\circ \\sin 10^\\circ}{\\sin 10^\\circ} = \\frac{-\\cos 10^\\circ + 4 \\cos 10^\\circ \\sin 10^\\circ}{\\sin 10^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nWe can factor out \\(\\cos 10^\\circ\\) from the numerator:\n\n"
