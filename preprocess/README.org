#+title: Preprocess datasets for OpenR
#+author: Ziqin Gong

** Usage
Requires ~python=^3.12~. ~python=^3.11~ should be ok but hasn't been tested.

#+begin_example
usage: python cli.py [-h] [-t STEP_TAG] [-s SUFFIX]
              [--add-step-prefix] [--neutral-is-bad]
              DATASET_TYPE FILE

positional arguments:
  DATASET_TYPE             Which dataset FILE is (prm800k, math-aps, math-aps-tree, or math-shepherd)
  FILE                     Path to the original dataset file

options:
  -h, --help               show this help message and exit
  -t, --step-tag STEP_TAG  Step tag. Default: \n\n\n\n\n
  -s, --suffix SUFFIX      Suffix appended to FILE for the output path. Default: new
      --add-step-prefix    Prepend "Step i: " to each step. PRM800K only
      --neutral-is-bad     Treat `neutral` as negative labels for PRM800K. PRM800K only
#+end_example

Note that if you directly pass ~"\n\n"~ to ~--step-tag~, the script receive ~"\\n\\n"~ instead of two
newlines. Several solutions are suggested in [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/50642130][this answer]], but none worked for me. Also be cautious
about using step tags that contain non-ascii characters when preprocessing Math-APS datasets,
because for now this script drops any rationale that contains non-ascii characters, even if it is
only the step tag that contains them. You are welcome to open an issue or pull request to make an
improvement.

** Datasets
- PRM800K: [[https://github.com/openai/prm800k][GitHub repo]]
- Math-APS: collected by ~data/omegaPRM_v2/~ with ~save_data_tree=False~
- Math-APS-tree: collected by ~data/omegaPRM_v2/~ with ~save_data_tree=True~
- Math-Shepherd: [[https://huggingface.co/datasets/peiyi9979/Math-Shepherd][Hugging Face dataset]]
